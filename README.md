# phone2actioncodesample

Here are a few bits of sample code I extracted out of one of my test projects. 

The code gives an example of some current work doing TDD/BDD with the following:
- a small TDD (PHPUnit) driven blog api example
- a small BDD (Mocha) driven Single File Vue Component
- a small BDD (PhpSpec) driven code kata for the mergesort algorithm 
- a small BDD (Dusk) driven integration of the Vue component into a blade view file
